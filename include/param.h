// default; raising this past 4095 needs balloc() itself extended to
// span multiple bitmap sectors first. 4000 (2MB, up from the
// original 1000/500KB) is comfortably under that ceiling while
// giving real room to grow: as of this comment, UPROGS plus
// usr/lib/libc.so plus usr/bin/cat alone (see the Makefile) already
// used 884 of the original 1000 blocks, leaving usertests.c's own
// bigfile test (writetest1(), which deliberately writes a
// MAXFILE-sized ~70KB/140-block file to exercise indirect-block
// handling) no room to run without hitting balloc()'s "out of
// blocks" panic - confirmed by hitting exactly that panic once real
// coreutils utilities pushed usage that high.

// mkfs/mkfs.c's balloc() now writes a real multi-sector bitmap (nbitmap
