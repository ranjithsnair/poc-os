//PAGEBREAK: 36
// Layout of the trap frame built on the stack by the hardware and by
// kernel/trapasm.asm, and passed to trap(). Long mode has no pusha, so
// trapasm.asm pushes registers one at a time in a chosen order (see the
// comment there) - the fields below are listed in reverse of that push
// order (last pushed = lowest address = first field). ds/es/fs/gs are
// dropped entirely: once segmentation is flat, as it is here, reloading
// them on every trap has no effect and saving them is pointless.
//
// eip/esp/eflags/eax keep their 32-bit-conventional names (rather than
// rip/rsp/rflags/rax) even though they're uint64 - trap.c, proc.c,
// exec.c, and syscall.c reference these fields by name; only their
// width matters, and callers that cast into/out of them already use
// the arch-neutral uintp type for exactly this reason.
//
// There's no ds/es/fs/gs here at all - not even as inert padding.
// That was tried and is exactly wrong: sizeof(this struct) has to
// equal precisely what trapasm.asm's alltraps actually pushes (this
// struct's layout is its contract), because whole-struct copies of
// *p->tf (fork()'s `*np->tf = *curproc->tf`, in particular) read/
// write exactly sizeof(struct trapframe) bytes starting at p->tf -
// which for a real (not proc.c's userinit()-constructed fake initial
// one) trapframe sits flush against the top of the process's one-page
// kernel stack. Padding this struct out with unused trailing bytes
// made every such copy read past the end of that page.
